Title: Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) Solvers Written in R Using S4 Classes
Version: 0.100.0.9000
Authors@R: person("Alfonso R.", "Reyes", role = c("aut", "cre"), email = "alfonso.reyes@oilgainsanalytics.com")
Description: Show physics, math and engineering students how an ODE solver
    is made and how effective R classes can be for the construction of
    the equations that describe natural phenomena. Inspiration for this work 
    comes from the book on "Computer Simulations in Physics" 
    by Harvey Gould, Jan Tobochnik, and Wolfgang Christian.
