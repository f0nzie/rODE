* Build vignettes with `devtools::build_vignettes()`. 
* Problem with `knitcitations` and `doc/` folder

# rODE 0.99.6.9000
* 20171110-201711__
* 

# rODE 0.99.6
* 20171110
* approved by CRAN as 0.99.6

# rODE 0.99.5.9008
* 20171110
* release to CRAN as 0.99.6

# rODE 0.99.5.9007
* 20171109-20171109
* add exercise using the ODE Solver RK4. find the saturation value at pressure of 3 with a time step 0.05
* remove Google citations URL link because they do not work
* add file `rODE_biblio.bib` edited with JabRef
* add knitcitations and some bibliography
* move NAODE vignette to notebooks

# rODE 0.99.5.9006
* 20171107-20171107
* Plot the errors between the ODE solver solutions
* Create a one-step approach using two nested lapply functions iterating through the all the solvers and all the step sizes.
* Using a ODEFactory to send only the name of the solvers instead of composing an implementation for each of the solvers
* Show two solvers first: Euler and Runge-Kutta. Compare results
* Start with Euler solver
* select step sizes to be 0.2., 0.1, 0.05
* add new vignette `Muskat-MBal`

# rODE 0.99.5.9005
* 20171105 - 20171106
* add vignette `ErrorEuler` that shows using an internal accumulator in the ODE solver class.
* `ErrorEuler` is similar to `ODETest` but differs in the way the loop has been built. The constructor receives an argument for the initial conditions of the variables. The loop is not controlled by time -as in `ODETest`-, but by the number of steps. The objective is to calculate and plot the step size versus the error. Two log-log plots are produced. A exact solution value is also calculated to find the error.
* modify vignette `Comparison` that shows the use of the internal accumulator.

# rODE 0.99.5.9004

* improve vignette Reaction with plots
* remove date from NEWS sections and move it as body text

# rODE 0.99.5.9002
* 20171103
* Use only 17 examples because adding more causes a problem in 00Index producing blank lines.
